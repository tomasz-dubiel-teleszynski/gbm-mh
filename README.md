MATLAB implementation of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for estimating parameters of a Geometric Brownian Motion as in this paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1059056017302162. It begins with START_GBM_MCMC_est_single.m file in the CODE folder. Alternative implementation using adaptive Metropolis algorithm begins with START_GBM_MCMC_est_joint.m file in the same folder.
